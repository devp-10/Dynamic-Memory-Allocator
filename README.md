# Dynamic Memory Allocator

Developed a dynamic storage allocator for C programs by programming own versions of malloc, calloc, realloc, and free using a segregated list of free memory blocks to improve memory utilization to 60.8% and a throughput rate of 22,097 K ops/sec. Also employed a heap consistency checker to test and debug the code on large scale and maintain code integrity.

Look at **mm.c** for the main code.
